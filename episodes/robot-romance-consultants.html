      Love goes digital in this episode as robots take center stage as relationship consultants. Join us as we dive into the world of algorithmic matchmaking, explore the intricacies of AI relationship therapy, and ponder the consequences of robotic romance advice.

      From glitchy first dates to the pitfalls of artificial emotions, we dissect the highs and lows of a society where robots play cupid. Will artificial intelligence lead to perfect matches, or is love too complex for even the most advanced algorithms?

      Tune in for a robotic rendezvous in the world of Robot Romance Consultants!
